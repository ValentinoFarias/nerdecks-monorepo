# Design & Planning

## User Stories

### Core Learning Flow
- As a user, I want to create an account so I can save my decks and cards.
- As a user, I want to log in securely so I can access my personal learning material.
- As a user, I want to create decks so I can organize topics.
- As a user, I want to create cards inside decks so I can study specific content.
- As a user, I want to review cards using spaced repetition so I can remember them long term.
- As a user, I want to mark cards as correct or incorrect so the system can adjust review timing.
- As a user, I want to see only my own decks and cards.
- As a user, I want a clean and minimal interface so I can focus on studying.

## Agile Methodology

The project was developed using an iterative Agile approach:

- Features were broken down into user stories.
- Stories were grouped into iterations (MVP first).
- Tasks were created for:
  - Models
  - Views
  - Templates
  - Spaced repetition logic
  - Authentication
  - UI improvements

Kanban board structure:
- Backlog  
- To Do  
- In Progress  
- Testing  
- Done

## Typography

The project uses:

- Inter – for clean, readable UI text
- Space Grotesk – for headings and branding
- Fredoka – for playful brand personality

These fonts were chosen for clarity and modern appearance.

## Database Diagram

Main models:

- User (Django built-in)
- Deck
  - name
  - user (ForeignKey → User)

- Card
  - deck (ForeignKey → Deck)
  - front
  - back
  - step
  - due_at
  - created_at

Relationships:

- One User → Many Decks  
- One Deck → Many Cards  
- One Card → Belongs to exactly one Deck

## Manual Testing – User Stories

| User Story | Test | Pass |
|------------|------|------|
| Create account | User fills signup form and is redirected | ✓ |
| Login | User logs in with valid credentials | ✓ |
| Create deck | User submits deck form | ✓ |
| Create card | User submits card form | ✓ |
| Review card | User marks correct/incorrect | ✓ |

---

## Manual Testing – Features

| Feature | Action | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Deck creation | Submit valid form | ✓ |
| Card filtering by user | Login as different user | ✓ |
